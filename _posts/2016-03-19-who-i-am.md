# Who I am
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bf1f6b27-8338-4360-96d1-6b4c8260cbc8.jpg)

My Goal is to make you happy! To create work that is pleasing to the eye - sometimes at least disturbing to the mind - that carves your spirit while looking at it and work that is showing the glory of our creator Jhwh through the beauty of his creation!

I focus mainly on awesomeness, as you can see! No, but really I love doing almost every kind of photography from Portrait over Commercial to Landscape shooting and most of all I really focus on being creative and finding always new ways of perspective and angle in the field and then also in post-production.

For now my home base is in Salzburg, Austria, but you can book me all throughout Austria of course and everywhere around too! I love to travel and seeing new places to explore around the world!

You can contact me on G+ or Facebook:
