# Who I am

My first and foremost goal is to be a teacher someday. My main subjects will be Mathematics and Computer Engineering and my main hobby, you guessed it, is photography. I really love doing it and I want also to fire others so that they will love doing it to! Not only is it a very diversive work, from the lone wolf in the wild to the the witness of a marriage, but you can even make others happy and give them memories for the rest of their life!

Do I focus on any specific field? Yes, I want to wake emotions in You!  
I think this is challenging enough :)

Salzburg in Austria is my 'home base', but I love to travel and hike and of course having my camera with me on all these adventures.

After browsing my website you'll probably notice that I have a second home, which is Altaussee, where the new James Bond movie also played and much more important where my Grandma lives.

This is me and down there I'm shooting in the world famous Arches National Park.
